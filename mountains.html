<h1 class="mountainsofturkey">Mountains of Türkiye</h1>
<p class="montserrat-paragraph">Turkey's mountains are as diverse and majestic as the country's rich history. Mount Ararat, the country's tallest peak, is not only significant for its height but also for its biblical fame as the resting place of Noah's Ark. Its silhouette against the sky is iconic, and the climb to its summit is a journey through both alpine tundra and lore. The rugged ranges of the Taurus Mountains stretch across southern Turkey, with craggy peaks and deep gorges that have carved their stories into the land over millennia. In the north, the Pontic Mountains, draped with lush forests and dotted with alpine lakes, roll gently towards the Black Sea, offering a softer, green embrace. The Kackar Range, home to the soaring Mount Kackar, presents the most alpine environment in Turkey, with glacial lakes and meadows that explode with wildflowers in the spring. Meanwhile, the volcanic landscapes of Mount Erciyes and Mount Hasan provide a stark contrast with their moon-like surfaces and conical peaks. Each of these mountains carries its own unique spirit, history, and challenge, representing the natural splendor of Türkiye.</p>
