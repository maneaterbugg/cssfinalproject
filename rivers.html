    <p>
        The rivers of Turkey stitch the landscape together, flowing through verdant valleys, ancient civilizations, and modern cities. The mighty Euphrates and Tigris, cradle of civilizations, begin their long journey in the highlands of eastern Turkey, while the Meander River winds its way through the western part of the country, reflecting its name as it twists and turns lazily to the Aegean Sea. These rivers are more than just waterways; they are lifelines that have nourished human settlement, agriculture, and the very history of the region for thousands of years. Whether it's the tranquil beauty of the Kızılırmak or the strategic significance of the Dardanelles Strait, Turkey's rivers have stories to tell, blending natural splendor with the flow of history.</p>
